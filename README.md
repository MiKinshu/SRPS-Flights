# SRPS Flights

This was our fall Semester project for the subject Object Oriented methodologies. 

## Problem Statement

The main objective of this application is to decrease the manual mistakes engaged in the commercial airline booking process and create it practical for the clients to book the routes as when they require such that they can implement this application to create bookings, change bookings or terminate a particular booking.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, all you need to do is clone or download this project. Open this project in android studio and run it on any android device or emulator.  We were strictly asked to not use any Database and as such upon opening the app the users must sign-in everytime. Alternatively you can use any of the two 2 hardcoded users.
1.  Login 1: (admin)
	* Username : test1
	* Password : 123456
2.  Login 2: (user)
	* Username : test2
	* Password : 123456

## Using the Application

On the very first screen users are asked to login/Sign-up. Once the users log in, they get 3 options.

1. Search Flights: The users can search flight given a to airport, a from airport and the date of journey. The app tells you all the direct flights and indirect flights between the two airports according to the input queries. Tapping on any flight(direct/connecting) takes you to the booking page, where users can pay and confirm the booking.

2. View Bookings: On tapping on the this button the user is taken to a screen showing all his bokings. They can they tap on any booking to cancel it.

3. Admin Access: This feature is only for Admins (Normal users cannot access this). This takes you to a screen where you can Add/Delete Airports and Add/Delete Flights.
